Plan for the application:

- models - expense, user, category - DONE
- expense creation, reports for a given month, update/delete of expenses, assigning categories to expenses (optional)
- endpoints: create expense, edit/delete expense, get expenses by date range, sum expenses/statistics
- auth methods - probably JWT, maybe with OAuth
- alembic setup for migrations - DONE
- .env to store env variables - DONE

Extension:
- expense recognition from a check
- frontend in React
- data export to CSV for statistic usage
- support for other currencies than PLN
